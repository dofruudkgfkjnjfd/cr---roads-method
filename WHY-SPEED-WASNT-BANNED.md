# he was not banned because

because the people who coded it are retarded

they gatekeeped less than 20 lines of code. it got leaked, and it uses something as simple as letter rearrangement. not only that, everyone joined at once so it couldn't send enough reports

basically meaning that if you don't have 1 player servers the shit will not work

someone could easily revise the code and make it 10 times more effective but im just waiting for someone to do that.

peace out, copper. join dsc.gg/coppaware
