# he was not banned because...

because the people who coded it are retarded, and roblox's servers are retarded!!!!!

they gatekeeped less than 20 lines of code. it got leaked, and it uses something as simple as letter rearrangement. not only that, everyone joined at once so it couldn't send enough reports so basically blame the fact the new game had like 30 player servers

basically meaning that if you don't have 1 player servers the shit will not work. so much for making a whole ass drama 
for the code to be possible to recreate by any old lua user. the code needs a revision. i know someone who's willing to in dsc.gg/coppaware 

so stay tuned.

another thing is look at this fucking screenshot https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984286570372816926/998774977224511609/unknown.png

mfs are so excited for a game that can easily be avoided by not clicking any game links. this is entirely roblox's fault for keeping a vulnerable chat system for 
15 fucking years!! **you can already make other people chat with serversides!!!** this is literally nothing new!!!
