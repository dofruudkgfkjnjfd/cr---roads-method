# YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHY SPEED DIDN'T GOT BANNED...

The simple answer is that since he have ton of fans, they all joined and there was an overflow in the server

They gatekeeped less than 20 lines of code. it got leaked, and it uses something as simple as letter rearrangement. Not only that, everyone joined at once so it couldn't send enough reports so basically blame the fact the new game had like 30 player servers

Basically meaning that if you don't have 1 player servers the shit will not work. You can learn how to set your server to Maximum 1 Player via the following link: https://www.techy.how/tutorials/roblox-maximum-players

Roblox does know about this exploit (they're trying to sue DWC but they literally can't due to the fact they left that vulnerability in there) + they got hwid banned too
