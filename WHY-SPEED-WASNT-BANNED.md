# YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHY SPEED DIDN't GOT BANNED...

The simple answer is that since he have ton of fans, they all joined and there was an overflow in the server

They gatekeeped less than 20 lines of code. it got leaked, and it uses something as simple as letter rearrangement. Not only that, everyone joined at once so it couldn't send enough reports so basically blame the fact the new game had like 30 player servers

Basically meaning that if you don't have 1 player servers the shit will not work. You can learn how to set your server to Maximum 1 Player via the following link: https://www.techy.how/tutorials/roblox-maximum-players

Another thing is look at this screenshot https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984286570372816926/998774977224511609/unknown.png
Roblox does know about the exploit because they HWID banned the developer of the games & terminated some of the games by hands. So probably if this github thread get's ton of views and there is even more games from now on, they will fix it the quickest possible.
